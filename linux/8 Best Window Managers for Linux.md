A window manager should be helpful if you dabble with multiple active windows on your system and want to make the most out of the available screen space.

Sure, you can re-size and reposition your windows to organize them to some extent. However, with a window manager, you can **step up your multitasking potential** by organizing the windows using keyboard shortcuts, mouse and even automating some of it.

With a window manager, you can **improve not only the productivity but the look and feel of your desktop** if you decide to put in the effort.

Here's an example of a user's customized desktop using a window manager to organize the active windows:

ðŸ“‹

Most of the options mentioned work for the **Xorg display server**, considering window managers on Wayland are called compositors. You can explore [Arch's documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/window_manager) to learn more.

For multi-monitor setups, you might want to check for **RandR** and **Xinerama** protocol support with the window managers.

## Is it Easy to Use a Window Manager?

Yes and no.

If you decide to use a window manager, you must be willing to research/read documentation to get things right. It may not be feasible to cover everything in this article.

There are some points to note that include:

-   Some window managers provide you with room for endless customizability. If you do not know how to configure it to your liking, you may not be able to use it.
-   Some window managers might need configuration even before using it. Unless you do not set it up, you cannot utilize the window manager.
-   Most users prefer **Arch Linux** to use window managers. So, you can expect better community support for configurations/setup if you pick Arch Linux as your distro of choice. But, it is not mandatory, you can try other distributions.

Here, I provide the **links to its documentation, and the installation commands** to give you a head start.

To make things easy, you can also utilize other **users' dotfiles (configuration)** to quickly modify the look and behavior of your desktop. However, you still need to know what you're doing before you use them.

ðŸš§

Some window managers/compositors for Wayland may not support proprietary graphics drivers, including NVIDIA. So, before installing and configuring any of the window managers, you might want to check what it supports.

## 1\. bspwm

[![bspwm desktop screenshot](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2023/01/window-manager-example.jpg)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2023/01/window-manager-example.jpg)

[bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) is a **lightweight tiling window manager**. The first screenshot you see in this article was made possible using bspwm.

You must install the window manager and a separate package to use the keyboard/pointer bindings. bspwm lets you manually choose how new windows get inserted or positioned or set it to automatic mode, where it follows a particular scheme to arrange the windows.

You need to configure it properly before you get to use it. Unfortunately, the [documentation](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) for it may not be easy to follow for new users trying a window manager. [Arch Linux's documentation page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bspwm) on bspwm should help you get started.

**Install bspwm**

You can easily find the package for it on the official repositories of Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch.

For Ubuntu, type in the following command to get it installed:

```
sudo apt install bspwm sxhkd
```

ðŸ“‹

The list is in no particular order of ranking.

## 2\. Qtile

It packs in various features and yet a simple implementation. You get a command shell to inspect and manage all aspects of the window manager.

One of the highlights of Qtile is **complete remote scriptability**.

**Install Qtlie**

You can install Qtile using pip. Once you have [pip installed on Ubuntu](https://itsfoss.com/install-pip-ubuntu/), run these commands:

```
pip install xcffib
pip install qtile

herbstluftwm (I know, a mouthful) is a **manual tiling window manager**. Not as popular as other options, but a promising option for Linux users.
