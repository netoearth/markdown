Being an engineering leader comes in all shapes and sizes. My first “Head Of” role was “Head Of Software Engineering” at an energy efficiency focused startup consultancy. I was a team of one who built software, ran production and provided all office-based tech support. The team and responsibilities grew over time but it certainly started small.

Other colours in the spectrum of “Head Of” include “Head Of Department”, which I would roughly equate to Director of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer, which I consider to be a top level technology role.

I have been thinking about the responsibilities of a “Head Of” role. They do tend to start out relatively simple and increase in scope and complexity as the team grows. On that basis, if CTO is the broadest engineering “Head Of” roles then an aspiring engineering leader should be able to look at the responsibilities of a CTO and identify a subset of responsibilities that apply to their own role.

Below I have made an attempt to list the high level responsibilities of a CTO. There is a rabbit hole to dive into behind each bullet point and I have tried to resist the temptation.

I hope this is a useful jumping off point for anyone taking on a new “Head Of” role. Without further ado I give you

## CTO Checklist

## People

![A diverse group of people](https://miro.medium.com/max/770/0*mbnQ-dZ4ZLsMRoKI.jpg)

## Your team

-   Develop your leaders  
    \- The very best leaders develop their team to the extent that their leadership position can be successfully handed on to one of the team ([Level 5 leadership](https://hbr.org/2001/01/level-5-leadership-the-triumph-of-humility-and-fierce-resolve-2))
-   Delegate to your leaders (more on this later)
-   Stay in touch with your whole org  
    \- Meet with individual teams, listen to what they have to say  
    \- Do skip-level 1–1s with a broad range of your org
-   Lead with trust and transparency to get the best out of your team

## Personal development

-   Have a documented career ladder
-   Have good definitions for each level of the ladder, including examples of meeting and exceeding expectations
-   [Technical training matrix](https://engine.expert360.com/refactoring-our-engineering-skills-matrix-b5314e2b0013) with expectations for each role
-   Management training program
-   Ensure that every single person in your org has a career path and a development plan to help them get there
-   Have a robust, transparent performance review process

## Exec team

## Culture

-   Develop psychological safety in your team — lead by example
-   Enable innovation by setting guard rails and pushing down decision making
-   Move at the right speed — not too fast, not too slow

## Networking

-   You won’t have a peer who is a CTO at the company — find some who are at other companies then speak to them regularly
-   Present at public events: paying it forward / back and raising the profile of your company
-   Consider writing articles from time to time, e.g. on your company tech blog

## Processes

-   Know where your budget is being spent

I hope this definition is interesting and maybe inspires you to take your career in this direction. The full range of responsibilities may be a little daunting but remember that you have two tools to fight this: start small and delegate. Try surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you!

I am certain I have missed responsibilities and maybe I’m off the mark on some that are there — please share feedback to improve the list in comments. Enjoy!
